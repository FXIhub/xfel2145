# Data analysis

This is the top-level directory for all the post-beamtime analysis efforts.

Inside you will find multiple folders, **one for each task** ahead. Feel free
to contribute to the ones you wish, either by improving existing analysis
scripts or starting a new one from scratch.

Also please do raise an issue if you want to add **new analysis tasks**.

By having all the efforts combined in one place you'll be able to **learn**
from eachother, **avoid duplicating** work, and immediately see your **impact**.

It also contains the special `tutorial` folder which contains examples to
help you get started analysing data.
